# hello-world
This is a test repository to fiddle on a few things.

Hello there I have started learning Git!. I'll be updating this file as I go on.

Git is a version control system that allows developers working on a team to keep track of all the changes being made to a codebase.

By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.

On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what youâ€™ve done and why.
